I analized a Kaggle dataset with the H1 of a possible assosiation among to be a U.S. male and to suicide. The dataset is "Self harm and substance abuse related deaths by country, year (2017-20), and sex" (world dataset in the topic), it was exported to MS SQL and Azure Data Studio with the aim to run queries to analyze descriptively, and visually data and H1 investigation questions. 
As it is the Azure notebook contains queries and graphs.
Since this is a world sensus, the correlation is clearly unveil: to be a part of the men gender correlates with an increased risk of suicide during the lifetime, except at early stages from 0-9 years old, that this association might be questionable.
More statistically powerful analysis will corroborate this general observation.
